# Snake Game

A simple implementation of the classic Snake game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This version features a canvas-based gameplay environment where the player controls the snake to eat the red food, growing in length with each successful meal. The game continues until the snake collides with itself.

## Features

- **Infinite Walls**: The snake can move through the edges of the game board and appear from the opposite side, adding an extra twist to the traditional gameplay.
- **Simple Controls**: Control the snake using the arrow keys on the keyboard (Up, Down, Left, Right).
- **Classic Gameplay**: Just like the original, the goal is to grow as long as possible without running into yourself.

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
3. Use the arrow keys to control the snake.
4. Eat the red food to grow.
5. Avoid colliding with yourself, or the game ends.
